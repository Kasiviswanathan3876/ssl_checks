ssl checks
==========
This repo contains a collection of scripts to help with checking SSL configurations on a batch of sites.

##date_check.sh:
Checking the dates for when an SSL certificate is valid can help an organization to know if the certificate needs to be rotated.  This script takes in an input file named "EXTERNAL" which should contain a list of sites that require an SSL date check.
